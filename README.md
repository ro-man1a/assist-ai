# assist-ai
Your own personal AI helper.

### What is this?
Assist-AI is your own, private and personal assistant that runs completely local.

### How does it work?
It uses your Ollama API key that runs on your device and sends prompts to it and retrieves the output.

### How is this private?
- Runs on your own hardware - e.g. using your CPU and GPU
- No data is sent or accessed to servers

### What's the benefit of running this?
- Quicker, bitesized prompts that run on a small window instead of a large window with a large prompt.
- More customizability - you are able to customize how big the prompts are.
